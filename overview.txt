Results Tracking System - Application Overview
Executive Summary
The Results Tracking System is a corporate transformation platform designed with an "executive-first" UX philosophy. It combines learning, coaching, assessments, goals, and KPI tracking across individual → team → organization levels with leader visibility and AI guidance.

The platform follows the transformation flow: Clarity → Commitment → Execution → Measurement → Coaching → Results

Core Design Philosophy
1. Executive-First UX
Premium, high-whitespace aesthetic with a "finance dashboard" feel (not a fitness app)
Navy/charcoal color scheme with red accent color from the brand
Clean typography, generous spacing, minimal visual clutter
One-click clarity - each action is obvious and singular
2. Dynamic Blocks & Journey Hub
Content adapts based on user role (CEO, COO, CMO, etc.)
Blocks change based on stage (onboarding, active program, execution)
Progressive disclosure - show what matters now, hide the rest
3. Strategic Cascade
Everything flows from the top down:

Scorecard (Strategic) → Annual Planning → Quarterly Execution → Goals → Programs → Coaching
Navigation Architecture
Main Navigation (Sidebar)
The application uses a persistent left sidebar with 6 main sections:

Dashboard - Executive hub with dynamic blocks
Programs - Learning & leadership development catalog
Scorecard - Executive performance dashboard (NEW)
Goals - Planning & goal tracking system (NEW)
Coaching - 1:1 coaching and team development
Assessments - (Placeholder for future)
3-Level LMS Hierarchy
The Programs section follows proper LMS navigation patterns:

Level 1: Programs Catalog (browse all programs)
Level 2: Program Detail (overview, modules, progress)
Level 3: Module View (lesson content, video, exercises)
Example: Programs → LeaderShift → Module 3: Self-Leadership

Summary
The Results Tracking System is a comprehensive executive transformation platform that combines strategic planning (Scorecard), tactical execution (Goals), leadership development (Programs), and performance coaching (Coaching) into one integrated experience.

The key innovation is the strategic cascade - everything connects. Your Scorecard defines what matters. Your Annual Plan breaks it into pillars. Your Quarterly Plan creates 90-day sprints. Your Goals track specific metrics. Your Programs build the competencies needed. Your Coaching sessions accelerate execution.

It's designed for busy executives who need clarity fast, not complexity. One click, one action, one clear path to results.



1) Account Structure and Roles
Agency Account → Client Subaccounts

From the agency (parent) account, you can create client subaccounts.

Each subaccount has user roles:

Account Admin

Account User

Program-Level Roles (inside a specific program)

A person’s role can change depending on the program they’re in:

Facilitator (runs/delivers the program)

Mentor (participant’s boss / manager)

Participant (learner)

Important rule you noted: the menu/actions available inside a program change based on this program role.

2) Subaccount Navigation (Main Menu)

In a client subaccount, the main menu is:

Dashboard

Programs

Scorecard

Goals

Coaching

Assessments

Announcements

Feed

Members

Resources

Settings

This implies a platform that supports: learning programs + performance tracking + coaching + assessments + comms/community + member management + account configuration.

3) Assessments (180 + 360)
Assessment Types

360 Peer Assessment: Boss, peer, self, direct reports

180 Assessment: Boss and self

Key behavior you want

Assessment results should inform goal creation.

Example automation:

If someone scores low on Collaboration, the system shows a prompt like:

“Would you like to add Collaboration as a goal?”

“What other goals would you like to add?”

So assessments aren’t just reports—they drive next-step actions (goal suggestions + guidance).

4) Program Creation (Admin Setup Fields)

When creating a program, there are Program Settings including:

Basic Details

Program name

Program category (example: Live)

Program language (example: English)

Support + Ownership

Support email

Support telephone

Program creator (example: Andrew Oxley)

Notes: 1 file, resized, best as square 200x200

Program Type (community visibility)

Cohort program: interaction + communication with other learners enabled

2) Global User + Role Controls

Manage agency team members (who can access what)

Permissions for agency staff like:

Agency Owner

Why This Stack:

Drizzle over Prisma:
- Better PostgreSQL feature support (RLS, JSON, arrays)
- Faster queries, smaller bundle
- Closer to raw SQL, more control
- No Prisma Client bloat

Hono over Express/Fastify:
- Modern, built for TypeScript
- Works on Cloud Run, edge, Node
- Tiny bundle size
- Excellent performance

Next.js benefits:
- Server Components for faster page loads
- Built-in API routes option
- Middleware for auth/tenant checks
- Image optimization
- Great developer experience

TypeScript everywhere:
- One language across entire stack
- Share types between frontend/backend
- Catch errors at compile time
- Better IDE support and refactoring

Cost Optimization Tips:

1. Use Cloud SQL db-f1-micro for dev/staging (save ~$50/mo)
2. Committed use discounts (1-3 year) save 20-50% on Cloud SQL
3. Set Cloud Run min instances to 0 for dev environments
4. Use Cloud Storage Coldline for archived files (80% cheaper)
5. Batch SMS notifications into digests to reduce volume
6. Prefer email over SMS when possible (much cheaper)
7. Cache aggressively with Redis to reduce database load
8. Use connection pooling to reduce Cloud SQL connections

One-Time Costs:

Apple Developer Account: $99/year (if building iOS app)
Google Play Developer: $25 one-time (if building Android app)
Domain name: $12-50/year

The core idea

Subaccounts run programs. The agency account runs the system.
So the agency account should own: creation, governance, reusable assets, analytics, and support.

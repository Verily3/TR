**~100% of wizard data now persists to the database (all non-image fields via `config` JSONB).**

## Critical Issues

### C-01: Email Configuration Completely Dropped

**Where:** Wizard Step 4 → `CreateProgramWizard.tsx`, `onCreate()` handler
**Problem:** Step 4 collects 7 email toggles + 8 reminder day settings (before/after due date). None are included in the `onCreate(formData)` payload passed to the API. The `createAgencyProgramSchema` / `createProgramSchema` Zod schemas have no `emailSettings` field.
**Effect:** All program email preferences are always the hardcoded defaults. Admins cannot customize emails per-program at creation time or save their choices.

### C-02: Step 4 Toggle Buttons Are Visual-Only

**Where:** `CreateProgramWizard.tsx` Step 4 render
**Problem:** Email toggle buttons have no state management — clicking them changes visual appearance but doesn't update `formData.emailSettings`. The component renders the `defaultEmailSettings` constant without binding it to mutable state.
**Effect:** Even if Step 4 data were passed to the API, the values would always be the hardcoded defaults because the toggles don't actually track state.

### C-03: Learning Objectives Not Persisted

**Where:** Wizard Step 2, API schema
**Problem:** Step 2 collects 3+ learning objectives (`{ id, text }`). The `objectives` array is not in either program creation API schema and is not saved anywhere. No `program_objectives` table exists.
**Effect:** Objectives disappear after creation. The program overview page has no objectives to display; the field shown in the program detail is likely a static string.

### C-04: Cover Image Upload Not Implemented

**Where:** Wizard Step 1 drag-drop zone
**Problem:** The UI shows a drag-and-drop image upload zone that accepts PNG/JPG up to 5MB. There is no upload handler, no presigned S3 URL request, and no multipart form submission. The field `coverImageUrl` accepts a text string in the form state but is never sent.
**Effect:** Programs cannot have cover images. The API field `coverImage` exists in the schema and DB but is always null.

### C-05: No Date Validation in Tenant Program Route

**Where:** `packages/api/src/routes/programs.ts` POST `/api/tenants/:tenantId/programs`
**Problem:** The agency route (`agencies.ts`) validates `startDate < endDate` and returns a 400 if violated. The tenant route has no equivalent check. A tenant admin can create a program with `endDate` before `startDate`.
**Effect:** Programs with inverted date ranges break downstream scheduling, progress calculation, and email reminder logic.

---

## High-Severity Issues

### H-01: Pacing Settings Never Sent to API

**Where:** Wizard Step 3 (cohort path), API schema
**Problem:** `allowIndividualPacing`, `startOffset` (days after enrollment start), and `deadlineFlexibility` (days of buffer) are collected in the wizard but are not explicitly mapped into the API payload. The `config` JSONB field could store them, but the wizard's `onCreate()` handler doesn't pack them into `config`.
**Effect:** All cohort programs behave identically regardless of pacing selection. No per-learner flexibility is enforced.

### H-02: Target Audience / Prerequisites / RecommendedFor Dropped

**Where:** Wizard Step 5, API schema
**Problem:** `targetAudience`, `prerequisites`, and `recommendedFor` are collected (large textareas) but not in either program creation schema. The `ProgramConfig` interface in `programs.ts` defines these fields, but the API schema's `config` object definition does not accept them.
**Effect:** Metadata for program discovery and enrollment eligibility is lost. Cannot filter programs by prerequisites or audience.

### H-03: No Error Handling When Creation Fails

**Where:** `program-builder/page.tsx`, wizard `onCreate()` handler
**Problem:** The wizard closes immediately after calling `onCreate(formData)`. If the API call throws (network error, validation error, DB constraint), the modal closes and the user sees nothing — no toast, no error modal, no re-open. The mutation's `isError` / `error` state is not observed after dismiss.
**Effect:** Silent failures. Users lose all wizard data and must start over with no feedback.

### H-04: No Transactional Wrapping on Deep Copy

**Where:** `agencies.ts` — `use-template`, `assign`, `duplicate` handlers
**Problem:** Template deep-copy runs as individual sequential INSERTs: program → modules loop → lessons loop → tasks loop. If an INSERT fails midway (e.g., DB constraint), partial data is left in the database — the program record exists but has incomplete/missing modules or lessons.
**Effect:** Orphaned or corrupt program content in the DB. Requires manual cleanup.

### H-05: Wizard Data Not Validated Before Each Step

**Where:** `CreateProgramWizard.tsx`, step navigation
**Problem:** The "Next" button on each step advances unconditionally — no client-side validation runs. Required fields (`internalName`, `title`, `description`, `learningTrack`) are marked required in the schema but not checked before step advance.
**Effect:** User can reach Step 6 and submit with blank required fields, hitting a backend 400 with no recovery path (due to H-03).

## Medium-Severity Issues

### M-01: estimatedDuration Not Persisted (Self-Paced)

Step 3 self-paced path collects `estimatedDuration` (weeks). Not in API schema. Never saved. No `estimated_duration` field in `programs` table.

### M-02: sourceTemplateId Not Surfaced in UI

Programs track `sourceTemplateId` when created from a template. No UI shows which template a program derived from, and no "template lineage" view exists. Cannot track template → derived program relationships.

### M-03: Timezone Not Used Downstream

`programs.timezone` is saved but not applied to any scheduling logic — lesson due dates, cron jobs, and email sends all use UTC. The timezone field is decorative.

### M-04: Default Timezone Hard-Coded as America/New_York

Not derived from user profile, browser, or agency settings. All non-US programs default to ET.

### M-05: Duplicate Preserves isTemplate Flag

`POST .../duplicate` sets `isTemplate: original.isTemplate`, so duplicating a template creates another template. No confirmation or warning shown to user.

### M-06: No Self-Enrollment / Capacity Config in Wizard

API and `ProgramConfig` support `allowSelfEnrollment`, `requireManagerApproval`, `programCapacity`, `enableWaitlist`. None exposed in wizard. Must be set post-creation via Settings tab.

### M-07: Wizard Progress Not Persisted

Closing the wizard mid-way loses all entered data. No auto-save, no localStorage draft, no resume flow.

### M-08: Multi-Tenant allowedTenantIds No UI

`POST /api/agencies/me/programs` accepts `allowedTenantIds` array to share a single program across multiple tenants without copying. No UI exposes this; must be set via raw API call.

### M-09: Agency Route Creates Program With agencyId but No tenantId by Default

Agency program creation results in a program not scoped to any tenant until explicitly assigned. Program Builder list shows these as "agency-level" programs but learners can't enroll until a tenant copy is assigned.

---

## Low-Severity Issues

### L-01: No Wizard Completion Emails

No email sent to the creator or any admin when a program is created.

### L-02: No `creationSource` Audit Field

No way to distinguish programs created via wizard vs. API vs. template vs. duplicate.

### L-03: Soft Delete Doesn't Cascade to Children

`DELETE /api/.../programs/:id` sets `programs.deletedAt` but does not soft-delete child modules, lessons, or tasks. Direct queries on those tables without the program join may surface orphaned content.

### L-04: Objectives Displayed in Review Step via Placeholder

Step 6 review renders `formData.objectives.filter(o => o.text.trim())` — showing what was typed. But since objectives aren't saved, the program overview page cannot replicate this display from real data.

| After-Due Reminders (3 intervals)  | Cron job               | ✗ Not implemented            |

**Only 1 of 9 program emails is implemented.**
The cron handler at `POST /api/cron/notifications` is the intended home for scheduled emails but currently only handles assessment reminders.

## Recommended Fixes (Original Priority Order)

### Tier 1 — Fix Before Launch

1. ✅ **Fix toggle state management in Step 4** — bind `defaultEmailSettings` to mutable `formData` state
2. ✅ **Add `emailSettings` + `config` fields to API schema** — persist wizard pacing, audience, objectives, email prefs into `programs.config` JSONB (all these fit without a schema migration)
3. ✅ **Add date validation to tenant program route** — mirror the check in the agency route
4. ✅ **Wrap deep-copy operations in `db.transaction()`** — all three copy endpoints
5. ✅ **Add error boundary to wizard** — catch mutation errors, show toast, keep wizard open

### Tier 2 — High Value

6. ⏭ **Implement cover image upload** — presigned S3 URL on backend; file picker in wizard _(deferred: needs storage backend)_
7. ✅ **Persist objectives in `programs.config`** — simplest path (no new table needed); array of strings in JSONB
8. ⏭ **Send missing program lifecycle emails** — kickoff, digest, milestone, completion via cron _(deferred: M-03 dependency)_
9. ⏭ **Apply timezone to scheduling** — use `programs.timezone` when computing cron send times _(deferred: no lifecycle emails yet)_
10. ✅ **Validate all required fields per step** — client-side before advancing

### Tier 3 — Polish

11. ✅ **Auto-save wizard to localStorage** — resume on re-open
12. ✅ **Default timezone from browser** — `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`
13. ✅ **Show template lineage in program list** — "Created from: [Template Name]"
14. ✅ **Warn when duplicating a template** — duplicate now always sets `isTemplate: false`
15. ✅ **Add soft-delete cascade** — hard-deletes modules (lessons/tasks cascade via FK)
